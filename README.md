# PM2.5 Air Quality Classification using Deep Learning and Random Forest

This project focuses on classifying air pollution levels based on PM2.5 measurements using both Deep Learning and Random Forest models. The goal is to predict the air quality class (Bajo, Moderada, Insalubre, Muy_Insalubre) from sensor data using advanced machine learning techniques.
